# Cryptographic Analysis Internship at IIEST
**IIEST (Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology)** is a prestigious institution known for its strong focus on engineering and technology. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of undertaking an internship at IIEST, working closely with a renowned Professor **Dr. Malay Kule sir** (https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/cs-malay) in the field of **cryptography**. This experience allowed me to delve into the intricacies of cryptography and gain hands-on exposure to various techniques used in this domain.

As an intern, my primary responsibility was to analyze different cryptographic techniques and evaluate their effectiveness in securing data and communication systems. I worked on several projects under the guidance of the professor, focusing on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of various encryption algorithms, hashing functions, and key management protocols. This required me to study and implement cryptographic algorithms such as **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**

During my internship, I conducted extensive research, gathering relevant literature and scholarly articles to understand the theoretical foundations of cryptography. I also utilized various tools and programming languages, such as Python and C++, to implement and analyze cryptographic algorithms. This hands-on experience not only strengthened my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of the practical applications of cryptography.

Furthermore, I collaborated with other researchers and interns in the cryptography domain, participating in group discussions and brainstorming sessions. This collaborative environment fostered a rich exchange of ideas and allowed me to broaden my knowledge by learning from fellow enthusiasts and experts.

Overall, my internship at IIEST provided me with a comprehensive understanding of cryptography and its diverse applications. It equipped me with the ability to analyze and assess different cryptographic techniques critically. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also instilled in me a strong passion for cybersecurity and data privacy.
